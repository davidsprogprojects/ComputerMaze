A bot that can navigate a maze that is randomly generated using my student number

The program that generates the maze was created by the university of the west of england, while i added the code that allows the "bot" to navigate said map. This code is held in the "TheComputerMazeUDPClient.cpp" file. The client wont be able to run due to the server being offline and i have removed personal details such as my student number. This is here to showcase my programmig practices more than create a working project.
